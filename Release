Announcing the release of Perl Module Log::Topics Version 0.02
Uploaded to CPAN under my home directory as Log-Topics-0.02.tar.gz

This module was previously named File::Diagnostic, but has been
renamed under advice. The function names have also been changed
accordingly however the basic operation is the same. If you have used
File::Diagnostic please remove it and replace with this module. I
apologise for any inconvenience.

Log::Topics -  control flow of logging messages by named topics

This package provides services for controlling the output of logging
messages from an application. Log messages are identified by named
topics, and the messages for each topic can be directed or redirected
to file handles or files.
